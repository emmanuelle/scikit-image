Announcement: scikit-image 0.X.0
================================

We're happy to announce the release of scikit-image v0.X.0!

scikit-image is an image processing toolbox for SciPy that includes algorithms
for segmentation, geometric transformations, color space manipulation,
analysis, filtering, morphology, feature detection, and more.

New Features
------------


- A new doc tutorial presenting a cell biology example has been added to the
  gallery (#4648). The scientific content benefited from a much appreciated
  review by Pierre Poulain and Fred Bernard, both assistant professors at
  Universit√© de Paris and Institut Jacques Monod.
- We are experimenting with adding type hints in the signature of scikit-image
  functions. A few functions of ``skimage.segmentation`` have been annotated
  with type hints (#4794). A new subpackage ``typing`` has been created to
  define  specific image types ``Image``, ``Image2D``, ``Image3D``, ``Mask``
  and ``Labels``.
