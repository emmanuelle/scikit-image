New Features
------------

Documentation
-------------

- A new doc tutorial presenting a cell biology example has been added to the
  gallery (#4648). The scientific content benefited from a much appreciated
  review by Pierre Poulain and Fred Bernard, both assistant professors at
  Universit√© de Paris and Institut Jacques Monod.
- New tutorial on [visualizing 3D data](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/applications/plot_3d_image_processing.html) ([#4850](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/4850))
- Documentation has been added to the contributing notes about how to submit a
  gallery example 
- automatic formatting of docstrings for improved consistency ([#4849](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/4849))
- improved docstring for `rgb2lab` ([#4839](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/4839)) and `marching_cubes` [#4846](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/4846)


Improvements
------------



API Changes
-----------



Bugfixes
--------

- for the ransac algorithm, improved the case where all data points are 
  outliers, which was previously raising an error 
  ([4844](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/4844))
- an error-causing bug has been corrected for the `bg_color` parameter in `label2rgb` 
  when its value is a string 
  ([#4840](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/4840))


Deprecations
------------

- In ``skimage.feature.structure_tensor``, an ``order`` argument has been
  introduced which will default to 'rc' starting in version 0.20.
- ``skimage.feature.structure_tensor_eigvals`` has been deprecated and will be
  removed in version 0.20. Use ``skimage.feature.structure_tensor_eigenvalues``
  instead.
