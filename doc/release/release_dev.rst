New Features
------------
- Added majority rank filter - ``filters.rank.majority``.
- Added a new perimeter function - ``measure.perimeter_crofton``.

- A new doc tutorial presenting a cell biology example has been added to the
  gallery (#4648). The scientific content benefited from a much appreciated
  review by Pierre Poulain and Fred Bernard, both assistant professors at
  Universit√© de Paris and Institut Jacques Monod.

- Euler characteristic property of ``skimage.measure.regionprops`` was erroneous
  The bug is corrected. It is defined for 2D and 3D objects.


Deprecations

- In ``skimage.feature.structure_tensor``, an ``order`` argument has been
  introduced which will default to 'rc' starting in version 0.20.
- ``skimage.feature.structure_tensor_eigvals`` has been deprecated and will be
  removed in version 0.20. Use ``skimage.feature.structure_tensor_eigenvalues``
  instead.
